# Billing, Architecture, Security

##  Destroy your root account credentials, Set MFA, 


## Create an IAM user
- Sign in to the AWS Management Console with your root account credentials.
Navigate to the IAM service console.
- Click on the "Users" link in the left-hand menu and then click the "Add user" button.
- Enter a name for the user in the "User name" field.
- Select the "Programmatic access" and/or "AWS Management Console access" checkboxes to grant the user access to AWS resources via the AWS CLI, SDKs, or the AWS Management Console.
- If you select "AWS Management Console access", choose whether to create a custom password or allow the user to create their own password.
- Click "Next: Permissions".
- In the "Set permissions" step, you want to grant budget and cost alert permissions.
- Click on the "Permissions" tab and click the "Attach policies" button.
- In the search bar, search for "AWSBudgetsFullAccess" policy and select it.
- Click on "Attach policy".
The "AWSBudgetsFullAccess" policy grants the user full access to create, edit and delete budgets and also to receive budget notifications.
- Click "Next: Tags" to add tags to the user (optional).
- Click "Next: Review" to review your settings, and then click "Create user" to create the IAM user.


# To activate IAM user and role access to the Billing and Cost Management console
- Sign in to the AWS Management Console with your root user credentials (specifically, the email address and password that you used to create your AWS account).

- On the navigation bar, choose your account name, and then choose Account.

- Next to IAM User and Role Access to Billing Information, choose Edit.

- Select the Activate IAM Access check box to activate access to the Billing and Cost Management console pages.

# MFA
Multifactor authentication (MFA) is a security technology that requires multiple methods of authentication from independent categories of credentials to verify a user's identity for a login or other transaction.
Never, ever, use your root account for everyday use. Instead, head to [Identity and Access Management (IAM)](https://youtu.be/OdUnNuKylHg?t=967) and create an administrator user. 

- Protect and lock your root credentials in a secure place 
You will absolutely want to activate Multi Factor Authentication (MFA) too for your root account. And you won’t use this user unless strictly necessary.

- Now, about your newly created admin account, activating MFA for it is a must. It’s actually a requirement for every user in your account if you want to have a security first mindset.

-  Now we set up MFA for the [user](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_mfa_enable_virtual.html)

- we can login into our IAM user after inputing the MFA code 


## Seting up AWS Budgets & Billing Alarms

AWS Budgets is a service that enables you to set custom cost and usage budgets that notify you when you exceed or are forecasted to exceed your budgeted amount. With AWS Budgets, you can track your service usage and your expenses, so you can optimize your costs and adjust your usage when necessary. You can create budgets for specific services or resource groups, set custom alerts, and receive notifications via email or SMS.

We are gonna create 2 budget one for AWS credits and the other  for actual dollar spend


- Go to billing 
![Alt text](../journal_images/billing.png)

- click on budget and create budget

- Give the budget a unique name

![Alt text](../journal_images/budget1.5.png)

- Input your budgeted ammount mine here is $20

- Next and configure threshold for 50%, 75% and 100% and  email address

- Add threshold for 75% and 100%

- In the budget scpoe select all except "credit" 
and CREATE it
It should look ike this
![Alt text](../journal_images/budget2.3.png)

- we should have this two budget

# or

## Create an AWS Budget on the CLI

[aws budgets create-budget](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/budgets/create-budget.html)

Get your AWS Account ID
```sh
aws sts get-caller-identity --query Account --output text
```

- Supply your AWS Account ID
- Update the json files
- This is another case with AWS CLI its just much easier to json files due to lots of nested json

```sh
aws budgets create-budget \
    --account-id AccountID \
    --budget file://aws/json/budget.json \
    --notifications-with-subscribers file://aws/json/budget-notifications-with-subscribers.json
```
should look like this

## Billing set up using  CLI


### Creating SNS Topic

- We need an SNS topic before we create an alarm.
- The SNS topic is what will delivery us an alert when we get overbilled
- [aws sns create-topic](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/sns/create-topic.html)

We'll create a SNS Topic
```sh
aws sns create-topic --name billing-alarm
```
which will return a TopicARN

We'll create a subscription supply the TopicARN and our Email
```sh
aws sns subscribe \
    --topic-arn TopicARN \
    --protocol email \
    --notification-endpoint your@email.com
```
![Alt text](../journal_images/sns%20billing%20alarrm%20setup.png)


Check your email and confirm the subscription

you'll see this page:

![Alt text](../journal_images/Billing%20alarm%20email%20confirmed.png)


The pending status should have changed by now on the AWS sns console
![Alt text](../journal_images/biling%20alarm%20status.png)


#### Create Alarm

- [aws cloudwatch put-metric-alarm](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/cloudwatch/put-metric-alarm.html)
- [Create an Alarm via AWS CLI](https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/cloudwatch-estimatedcharges-alarm/)
- We need to update the configuration json script with the TopicARN we generated earlier
- We are just a json file because --metrics is is required for expressions and so its easier to us a JSON file.

```sh
aws cloudwatch put-metric-alarm --cli-input-json file://aws/json/alarm_config.json
```


## EventBridge 

EventBridge is a serverless service that uses events to connect application components together, making it easier for you to build scalable event-driven applications.
Use it to route events from sources such as home-grown applications, AWS services, and third- party software to consumer applications across your organization.
EventBridge provides a simple and consistent way to ingest, filter, transform, and deliver events so you can build new applications quickly. 




##  Conceptual Diagram in Lucid Charts or on a Napkin

A conceptual architecture diagram is a high-level representation of the system that shows the major components and how they interact with each other. It is often used in the early stages of a project to communicate the overall design and approach. This diagram is focused on the business concepts, requirements and goals of the system, and does not get into the details of specific technologies, platforms, or protocols.

- Looks like this:

## Logical Architectual Diagram in Lucid Charts

A logical architecture diagram is a more detailed representation of the system that shows how the major components and subsystems fit together, as well as how data flows between them. This diagram is focused on the logical components of the system, and often includes information about specific technologies, platforms, and protocols that will be used.
