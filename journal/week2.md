# Week 2 â€” Distributed Tracing

- Honey comb






## X-Ray 

AWS X-Ray helps developers analyze and debug production, distributed applications, such as those built using a microservices architecture. With X-Ray, you can understand how your application and its underlying services are performing to identify and troubleshoot the root cause of performance issues and errors.


- After going through the [aws-xray-sdk-python](https://github.com/aws/aws-xray-sdk-python)

Add to the `requirements.txt`

```py
aws-xray-sdk
```

Install pythonpendencies

```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Add to `app.py`

```py
from aws_xray_sdk.core import xray_recorder
from aws_xray_sdk.ext.flask.middleware import XRayMiddleware

xray_url = os.getenv("AWS_XRAY_URL")
xray_recorder.configure(service='Cruddur', dynamic_naming=xray_url)
XRayMiddleware(app, xray_recorder)
```

### Setup AWS X-Ray Resources

Add `aws/json/xray.json`

```json
{
  "SamplingRule": {
      "RuleName": "Cruddur",
      "ResourceARN": "*",
      "Priority": 9000,
      "FixedRate": 0.1,
      "ReservoirSize": 5,
      "ServiceName": "Cruddur",
      "ServiceType": "*",
      "Host": "*",
      "HTTPMethod": "*",
      "URLPath": "*",
      "Version": 1
  }
}
```


Paste in the terminal
```sh
aws xray create-group \
   --group-name "Cruddur" \
   --filter-expression "service(\"backend-flask\")
```
